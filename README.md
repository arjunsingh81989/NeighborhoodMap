# Neighborhood Map

Technologies: Knockout Javascript Framework, Bootstrap, jQuery

This application finds nearby attractions for your current location using Google Maps API and shows them in a map with markers.

The result is also displayed in a list that you can filter by entering some text to search by location's name and address.

Clicking a location in the list or a marker in the map will show a popup window with information about the location and related photos published on Flickr that are searched using Flickr's API.
